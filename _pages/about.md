Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/MATTEO-SILVESTRI_nP1872908_EN.aspx).  
My main research focuses on enhancing privacy in social networks, and I am part of the [HERCOLE Lab](https://hercolelab.netlify.app/) research laboratory.

I've always been fascinated by science in all its forms. With a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science, I enjoy understanding how things work at their core. Beyond tech, I have a creative sideâ€”I have a good hand in graphic design, photography, and video editing.

Sports have always played a big role in my life. I had a career in basketball, but honestly, I enjoy and can practice almost any sport.
Mens sana in corpore sana!
