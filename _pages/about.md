Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/). My research focuses on enhancing privacy in social networks, ensuring a safer and more secure digital world.

I've always been fascinated by science in all its forms. With a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, and computer science, I enjoy understanding how things work at their core. Beyond tech, I have a creative sideâ€”I have a decent hand in graphic design, photography, and video editing.

Sports have always played a big role in my life. I had a solid run in basketball, but honestly, I enjoy and can practice almost any sport. Staying active keeps me balanced and sharp.
